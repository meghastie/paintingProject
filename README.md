* My first practice of creating 2D graphics in java.
* A recreation of a simple Bob Ross inspired painting using the Swing library.
* Based on the youtube tutorial by 'Lean Code by Gaming'.
* This code features a series of inline comments to help me understand the fundemental concepts of creating 2d graphics.
